## Main Features

### Static Marketing Website

- Multi-page React website
- Static deployment-friendly architecture
- Route-level code splitting with lazy-loaded pages
- Mobile-first responsive layouts
- Clear presentation for a local agricultural business

### Business Pages

The website includes pages for:

- Homepage
- Products
- Gallery
- Contact
- About the business
- Firewood information
- Firewood ordering
- Privacy policy
- Cookie policy
- 404 fallback page

### SEO Support

The project includes SEO-focused implementation details such as:

- Page-specific metadata
- Open Graph-friendly structure
- JSON-LD structured data
- Sitemap generation script
- Custom domain configuration through `CNAME`

### Image Optimization

A custom image optimization pipeline generates modern image formats using Sharp.

Supported generated formats include:

- WebP
- AVIF
- Optimized responsive image assets

This helps improve:

- Page load speed
- Lighthouse scores
- Mobile performance
- SEO discoverability
- Bandwidth usage

### Contact Form Protection

The contact flow includes multiple client-side safeguards:

- Zod validation
- Honeypot field
- Anti-spam timing checks
- Cooldown protection
- React Hook Form integration

### Analytics and Privacy

Google Analytics support is consent-gated and controlled by an environment variable.

Analytics are only enabled when configured with:

```env
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

This keeps the project safer for privacy-conscious deployment and GDPR-oriented usage.

### Automated Deployment

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to GitHub Pages.

The workflow:

1. Installs dependencies
2. Builds the Vite app
3. Confirms the `CNAME` file exists in the build output
4. Checks that compiled assets are used instead of source entrypoints
5. Uploads the `dist` folder to GitHub Pages
6. Publishes the website

## Routes

| Route | Page |
|---|---|
| `/` | Homepage |
| `/prodotti` | Products |
| `/contatti` | Contact |
| `/galleria` | Gallery |
| `/chi-siamo` | About |
| `/legna` | Firewood information |

| `/privacy-policy` | Privacy policy |
| `/cookie-policy` | Cookie policy |
| `*` | Not found page |

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Use Node.js 20 or newer. The GitHub Actions deployment workflow is configured with Node.js 20.

Check your local versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

### Start Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will start the local development server and print the local URL in the terminal.

---

## Available Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts the Vite development server |
| `npm run build` | Creates the production build |
| `npm run build:dev` | Builds using Vite development mode |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Runs TypeScript checks |
| `npm run test` | Runs the Vitest test suite once |
| `npm run test:watch` | Runs Vitest in watch mode |
| `npm run sync:sitemap` | Generates or updates sitemap data |
| `npm run sync:images` | Generates optimized modern image assets |

---

## Build Process

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The production output is generated in:

```txt
dist/
```

Before building, the project automatically runs:

```bash
npm run sync:sitemap
npm run sync:images
```

This ensures sitemap and image assets are up to date before deployment.

---

## Preview Production Build

After running a production build, preview it locally with:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

## Testing

Run all tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

The project uses Vitest and Testing Library for frontend test coverage.

---

## Type Checking

Run TypeScript validation:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

This checks both the app TypeScript configuration and the Node/script TypeScript configuration.

---

## Linting

Run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file only when local environment configuration is needed.

Example:

```env
VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Do not commit private secrets or production-only credentials to the repository.

---

## Deployment

This project is configured for GitHub Pages deployment.

Deployment is handled by:

```txt
.github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

The workflow runs on pushes to:

- `main`
- `master`
- `work`

It can also be triggered manually through GitHub Actions using `workflow_dispatch`.

### Deployment Requirements

Make sure:

1. GitHub Pages is enabled for the repository.
2. The Pages source is configured for GitHub Actions.
3. The custom domain is correctly configured.
4. The `CNAME` file contains the production domain.
5. DNS records point to GitHub Pages.

---

## Custom Domain

The project includes a `CNAME` file for the custom domain.

Expected production domain:

```txt
www.cucurbitacee.com
```

The deployment workflow verifies that the `CNAME` file is present in the final `dist` output.

---

## Performance Notes

This project is designed to keep the production site fast by using:

- Vite production builds
- Route-level code splitting
- Static hosting
- Optimized image formats
- Minimal runtime dependencies
- Tailwind-generated CSS
- Lazy-loaded route components

---

## Accessibility Notes

The UI should continue to prioritize:

- Semantic HTML
- Clear page hierarchy
- Keyboard-friendly navigation
- Readable typography
- Good contrast
- Mobile-friendly spacing
- Descriptive alt text for images

---

## Development Guidelines

When modifying the project:

1. Keep pages focused and easy to scan.
2. Reuse existing components before creating new ones.
3. Keep business content clear, local, and customer-friendly.
4. Run linting and type checks before pushing.
5. Run the build before deployment changes.
6. Optimize new images through the existing image pipeline.
7. Keep privacy and analytics behavior consent-aware.

Recommended validation before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

---

## Future Improvements

Possible future enhancements include:

- Italian/English multilingual support
- CMS integration for seasonal updates
- Admin panel for products and galleries
- Serverless contact form backend
- Product filtering and search
- Seasonal landing pages
- Structured product inventory
- Newsletter signup
- Performance monitoring
- Automated image alt text auditing

---

## Troubleshooting

### Development server does not start

Try reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Build fails after adding images

Regenerate image assets:

```bash
npm run sync:images
npm run build
```

### GitHub Pages deploy fails

Check:

- GitHub Pages is set to GitHub Actions
- `CNAME` exists
- `npm run build` works locally
- The repository has Pages permissions enabled
- The deploy workflow has permission to write Pages artifacts
